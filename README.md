# Animal-Crossing-Drum-Kit
This is a drum kit modified from Wes Bos' (https://github.com/wesbos) drum kit program on day 1 of his JavaScript30 challenge (https://javascript30.com/). I of course don't intend to steal or take credit for his work. This project is an oportunity for me to practice my HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. 
The sounds and graphics are from/based on Animal Crossing. Credits to Nintendo :)
